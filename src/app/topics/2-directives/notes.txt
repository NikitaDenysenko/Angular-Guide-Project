* Renderer2 - Extend this base class to implement custom rendering.
By default, Angular renders a template into DOM. You can use custom 
rendering to intercept rendering calls, or to render to something other than DOM.

* @HostListener - Decorator that declares a DOM event to listen for, and
provides a handler method to run when that event occurs.

* @HostBinding - Decorator that marks a DOM property as a host-binding property 
and supplies configuration metadata. Angular automatically checks host property 
bindings during change detection, and if a binding changes it updates the host
element of the directive.

* TemplateRef - Represents an embedded template that can be used to instantiate 
embedded views. To instantiate embedded views based on a template, use the ViewContainerRef 
method createEmbeddedView().

* ViewContainerRef - Represents a container where one or more views can be attached to a component.
